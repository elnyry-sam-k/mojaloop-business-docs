# Introduction

This guide is aimed at the Operator of a Mojaloop Hub and provides information about the Business Operations portal, which facilitates the management of settlement-related processes on a daily basis.

::: tip NOTE
The Business Operations portal is commonly referred to as "Finance Portal v2".
:::

The portal provides functionality to:

* [manage (close and settle) settlement windows](managing_windows.md)
* [check settlement details](checking_settlement_details.md)
<!--* download settlement reports-->
* [monitor DFSP financial details such as Balance, current Position, Net Debit Cap, percentage of NDC used](monitoring_dfsp_financial_details.md)
* [update a DFSP's Net Debit Cap](updating_ndc.md)
* [record deposits to or withdrawals from a DFSP's liquidity account](recording_funds_in_out.md)

::: tip NOTE
The Business Operations portal currently only supports settlement processes that rely on the Deferred Net Settlement model.
