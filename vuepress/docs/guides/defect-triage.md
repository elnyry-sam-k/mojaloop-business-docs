# Defect triage

The purpose of the defect triage process is to ensure that all the bugs identified in the Hub Operator's Production environment are captured, evaluated, prioritized, and submitted to a Mojaloop Support team, a team dedicated to running Support services for the technical operations of a Mojaloop Hub. This team can be insourced or outsourced (or even part insourced and part outsourced), depending on the level of expertise or capacity within your organization. If you decide to outsource this function, there are organizations within the Mojaloop community that do provide different levels of Support as a service. (For more information and referrals, contact the Mojaloop Foundation.)

The process proposed here applies to bugs identified in the Production environment, and new features or enhancements are outside its scope. However, to facilitate business conversations, Hub Operators can submit Service Requests describing functional requirements to the Support team. 

The Mojaloop Support Triage team is responsible for the evaluation and resolution planning of each bug raised in the Hub Operator's Production environment. The Triage team has the following members: 

* Mojaloop Product Manager (core Mojaloop)
* Product Manager of extensions or other components involved - Payment Manager, PortX, and so on
* Hub Technical Subject Matter Expert (Product Delivery, that is Development and QA)
* Operations representative (Technical Operations and Infrastructure)

## Bugs identified in a Hub Operator Production environment

*Hub Operator steps:*

1. An incident ticket is raised in the Hub Operator's Service Desk tool by a Hub L1 Support Engineer, as per the [incident management process](incident-management.md).
1. The ticket is escalated to the Hub L2/L3 team for in-depth investigation and analysis, as required.
1. The Hub L2/L3 team evaluate if the behavior is a new bug or a known issue, and whether a ticket already exists. If it is a known bug and a Mojaloop Support ticket already exists, then the reporter must update the existing ticket with new details and information, and the priority and impact may be adjusted accordingly. New bugs will follow the rest of the process below.
1. The Hub L2/L3 team confirm that the issue can be reproduced in lower environments running the same version as the Production (PRD) environment. That is, the bug is not a user error or an environmental issue.
1. The Hub L3 team may escalate to the Hub Technical Operations Manager, and report the bug via the Mojaloop Support Service Desk tool, adding all details of their analysis, and reference the identifier of the incident ticket created in Step 1 for easy tracking. 
1. Response/acknowledgement/communication is sent back to the client DFSP within the agreed timelines.

*Mojaloop Support team steps:*

1. The Mojaloop Support team review, allocate a team member as owner, and acknowledge receipt of the bug. Following an initial review of the issue raised, the Mojaloop Support team member forwards the issue to the Triage team for further evaluation.
1. The Triage team evaluate the bug: enhancements/new feature requests are rejected. Operational impact, severity, and priority are reviewed and the bug resolution is assigned to the relevant Product Manager. For details on prioritization, see [Prioritization of bugs](#prioritization-of-bugs).
1. The Product Manager clones the bug into their Product Delivery team's product backlog, which links both issues for reference and progress tracking. The Product Manager also reviews and sets priority against other items in the product backlog.
1. The Mojaloop Support Engineer assigned to the Mojaloop Support bug ticket watches the cloned ticket and handles all communication between the Product Manager and the Hub Operator on the progress of the bugs, including sharing any remediation steps (for example, for the Hub to apply a workaround or suggesting an alternative way of using the affected functionality). Each subsequent update from the Product Delivery team should also be shared in the Product Manager bug ticket for visibility to the Hub Operator. The Product Manager assignee must remain the owner of the Product Manager bug ticket until the bug is resolved.
1. The Product Manager communicates the resolution plan and timelines back to the Product Manager team via the original Product Manager bug ticket. The resolution plan is then communicated to the Hub Operator. \
\
For details on what happens if the Hub Operator does not agree with the proposed prioritization and resolution plan, see [Escalation process](#escalation-process). 
1. The bug is resolved following the standard development process and is included in a release, which will be made available to the Hub Operator or can be offered as an ad-hoc On Demand release, if required. 
1. The Mojaloop Support ticket is closed once the bug fix release is deployed and validated in the Hub Operator's Development environment.

## Bugs identified during deployment/change window in Hub environment

Deployments into Hub environments are the responsibility of the Hub Operator's team, and bugs identified during the deployment should be raised via the standard process (that is, a ticket is raised as per the Hubâ€™s incident management process and then escalated to the Mojaloop Support team if required). In addition: 

* The Hub team will evaluate if the behavior is a known issue or a new defect. For known issues, the release will proceed and be completed as planned with the known bug reported as part of the post-implementation report.
* For new defects identified, the release/change is rolled back and regression tests will be executed to confirm that the previous working version is stable on the environment and the bug reported as part of the post-implementation report.
* The bug is captured via the Mojaloop Support Service Desk tool and will be handled via the process described above.

## Prioritization of bugs

The prioritization of bugs is the responsibility of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in the Triage team. 

All bugs are evaluated based on the expected behavior of the system and the actual behavior identified. The operational impact and the urgency of the bug must be captured by the Hub Operator's Operations team in order for this to be considered by the Triage team in the prioritization.

Every bug is evaluated against the Product roadmap and backlog.

New features or enhancement requests are rejected from this process and communicated back to the requester via the Operations team.

::: tip
Priority is the order in which the bug will be fixed. The higher the priority, the sooner the bug will be resolved. \
\
Severity is the level of impact on the Hub or to its users. \
\
These two factors work hand in hand. For example, a cosmetic bug like a typo on a webpage will likely be ranked as low severity but could be a quick and easy fix and ranked high priority. Hence, it is important to set these values with due consideration.

## Escalation process

If there is any discrepancy between severity, priority or the client's (DFSP's) expectations and the resolution plan provided by the Mojaloop Support team, the [incident management escalation matrix](incident-management-escalation-matrix.md) governs what happens next. Accordingly, the incident will be set as priority P1 or any other lower priority type and stakeholders will be informed.

The Hub Operator Program Manager and the Mojaloop Support Program Manager must be informed immediately.

## Ownership and responsibility

The creator of the Service Desk ticket (the Hub Operator's Support Engineer) remains the owner until the ticket is resolved.

Priority and severity must be aligned, discussed, and negotiated between the Mojaloop Support Triage team and the Hub Operator's Operations team.

Information from triage discussions and from the Product Delivery team must be shared in the Service Desk ticket by the Mojaloop Support Engineer. 

The Product Manager who is assigned the bug, must ensure that cross-referencing and tracking is in place for the Product Delivery team to groom and accept the bug. 

The Product Manager who is assigned the bug, must determine and communicate the resolution plan back to the Mojaloop Support team.
