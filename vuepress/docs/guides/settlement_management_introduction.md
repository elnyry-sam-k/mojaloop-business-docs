# Introduction

Real-time payments between Digital Financial Service Providers (that is, payments immediately cleared and reconciled) result in accounting credits/debits. These credits/debits must be settled at regular intervals through the movement of money between Digital Financial Service Provider (DFSP) accounts, allowing DFSPs to regularly balance their accounts with other DFSPs. DFSPs own liquidity bank accounts at a partner settlement bank, allowing the bank to move funds in/out of DFSPs' accounts in the execution of settlement instructions.

This guide describes how settlements are managed by the Mojaloop Hub and the partner settlement bank(s). It introduces the main building blocks of settlement processing, and describes the processes and tools involved in settlement management.

<question: will this guide really talk about processes and tools?>
